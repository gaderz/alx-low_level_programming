# C - SINGLY LINKED LIST

* A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes where each node stores a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node points to NULL.

* The C programming language provides a way to implement singly linked lists using structures and pointers. To create a singly linked list, you start by defining a structure for each node that contains a data member and a pointer to the next node. Then, you create a pointer to the head of the list, which initially points to NULL.

* To insert a new node into the list, you allocate memory for a new node, set its data member, and update the next pointer of the last node in the list to point to the new node. To delete a node from the list, you update the next pointer of the previous node to point to the next node, and then free the memory of the deleted node

* Singly linked lists are useful for implementing dynamic data structures that can grow or shrink in size during runtime. They are also commonly used in algorithms that involve sequential access to data, such as searching, sorting, and traversal.
