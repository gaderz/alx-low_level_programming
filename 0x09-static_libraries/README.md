# static libraries in C #


Static libraries in C are a collection of object files that can be linked with a program during the compilation process. 
They are a way to organize and reuse code in multiple projects without having to recompile the code each time.

## Here are the steps to create and use a static library in C: ##

* Write the source code for the functions you want to include in the library, 
  and compile them into object files with the "-c" flag.

* Once you have compiled all the source files into object files, 
  create the static library with the "ar" command.

* To use the static library in your program, include its header file in your source code and link with the library during compilation.

* And that's it! With these simple steps, you can create and use static libraries in your C projects to make your code more organized and reusable.
