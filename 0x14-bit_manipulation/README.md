# C BIT MANIPULATION

* C - Bit manipulation refers to the manipulation of individual bits of data in a byte or word. In C language, bitwise operators are used for performing bit-level operations. These operators include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), left shift (<<), right shift (>>), and complement (~)

* Bit manipulation is often used in low-level programming, such as in embedded systems, device drivers, and cryptography. It can be used for tasks such as setting or clearing a particular bit, checking if a bit is set, and performing arithmetic operations on binary numbers.

* Using bit manipulation can result in more efficient code, as it can save memory and reduce processing time. However, it can also make code harder to read and debug, so it should be used judiciously
