#  C - MALLOC, FREE #

## This README provides information about the C programming language's dynamic memory allocation functions malloc() and free(). ##

Memory allocation is a crucial aspect of programming, especially when it comes to managing large data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. 
The dynamic memory allocation functions in C allow you to allocate and free memory during program execution dynamically.

##  Malloc(): ##

* The malloc() function in C is used to dynamically allocate a block of memory in the heap. 
* It takes one argument, the number of bytes to be allocated, and returns a void pointer (void*) to the first byte of the allocated block if successful. 
* Otherwise, it returns NULL if there is not enough memory available to satisfy the request.


## Free(): ##

* The free() function is used to deallocate a block of memory previously allocated by malloc(). 
* It takes a pointer to the block of memory to be freed as its argument.

# COMCLUTION #

Dynamic memory allocation is an essential feature of the C programming language, allowing for the creation of data structures whose size can be determined at runtime. 
The malloc() and free() functions allow for the allocation and deallocation of blocks of memory during program execution, making it possible to manage memory efficientl
