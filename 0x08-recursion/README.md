# C - Recursion #

* Recursion is a powerful technique in programming that involves a function calling itself. 
  In C, recursion is implemented through a function that calls itself until it reaches a base case, where the function returns a value without 
  calling itself again.

* Recursion can be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems. 
  It is often used to implement algorithms such as sorting and searching, as well as data structures such as trees and graphs.

* When implementing recursion in C, it is important to ensure that the base case is well-defined and that the recursive function is able to make 
  progress towards the base case with each recursive call. 
  It is also important to consider the performance implications of recursion, as each recursive call adds overhead to the program.

* Recursion can be a powerful tool in programming, but it should be used judiciously and with care. 
  Understanding how recursion works and how to use it effectively can help you write more efficient and elegant programs in C.
