# C - PREPROCESSOR

The C preprocessor is a tool that processes a C source code file before it is compiled. It is responsible for performing operations such as macro expansion, conditional compilation, and inclusion of header files. The preprocessor directives begin with a '#' symbol and are processed before the actual code is compiled.

* One of the primary uses of the preprocessor is to define macros. A macro is a piece of code that is given a name and can be used to replace any occurrence of that name in the code. Macros can be used to simplify code, make it more readable, and reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.

* Another use of the preprocessor is to include header files. Header files typically contain function prototypes and other declarations that are required by the code in the source file. The preprocessor reads the contents of the header file and includes it in the source code before compilation.

* Finally, the preprocessor can also be used to perform conditional compilation. This means that certain sections of code will only be compiled if a particular condition is met. For example, this can be used to compile different versions of a program for different operating systems or to enable/disable debugging code.

* Overall, the preprocessor is a powerful tool that allows C programmers to write more efficient, readable, and flexible code.
