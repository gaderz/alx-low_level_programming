in this section i will be solving my alx Tasks on function and Nested loops
NESTED LOOP: A nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement.
 That is why nested loops are also called “loop inside loops“. We can define any number of loops inside another loop


FUNCTION: A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, 
known as parameters, into a function. Functions are used to perform certain actions,
 and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times
