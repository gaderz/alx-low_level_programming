# Even More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C #


## Introduction ##

Welcome to the "C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings" project! This project builds on the concepts covered in the "C - Pointers, arrays and strings" project and dives deeper into the world of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming language. In this project, you will learn about multidimensional arrays, pointers to pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and advanced string handling techniques.

## Prerequisites ##

Before you begin this project, you should have a good understanding of the following concepts:

* Pointers and memory management in C

* Arrays and strings in C

* Basic C programming constructs such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and structures


# TASK 0 #

### Welcome to the "Fill Memory with Constant Byte "project"  ###

* This is a function in C programming language that fills a block of memory with a constant byte

* This can be useful in many applications, such as initializing arrays or clearing memory before reuse.

## Function Signature ##

### The function signature for the "fill memory with constant byte" function is as follows:

* This function takes a pointer to the memory block to be filled,

* the value of the constant byte to be used, 

* And the number of bytes to be filled.
