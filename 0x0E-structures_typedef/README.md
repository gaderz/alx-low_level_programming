# C - STRUCTURES, TYPEDEF

## C - Structures and typedef are two important concepts in the C programming language.

* Structures in C allow you to group together variables of different data types into a single entity. This can be useful for organizing related data and creating more complex data types. To define a structure, you use the keyword "struct" followed by the name of the structure, and then define the variables within the structure using a comma-separated list.

* Typedef in C allows you to create new data types based on existing ones. It can be used to give a more meaningful name to an existing data type, or to create a shorter name for a long or complex data type. To define a new data type using typedef, you use the keyword "typedef" followed by the existing data type and the new name for the type.

* Together, structures and typedef can be used to create more complex data structures and improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
